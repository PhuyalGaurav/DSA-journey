# Data Structures and Algorithms Journey

This repository is dedicated to my journey learning Data Structures and Algorithms. Feel free to use any of these in the future, i am making this so that i can do the same üòù.

## Introduction

I am embarking on this journey to deepen my understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms. This repository will serve as a record of my progress and a resource for others who are on a similar path.

## Contents

This code in this repository will contain:

- Code implementations
- Timing my code to check the time complexity of my algrithms
- checking the amount of memory used

## Contributing

While this is a personal learning journey, I welcome any suggestions or corrections. Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
